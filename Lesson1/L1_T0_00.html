		<p>The Stone County SMNS was opened in 2016. It was built in compliance with current Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines.  The shelter is over 23,000 square feet and meets FEMA 361 requirements.  The unprecedented facility, located in Wiggins, Mississippi, was designed to house a total between 100-150 patients, caregivers, and staff for a minimum of 72 hours.  It was designed to withstand Category 5 hurricane force winds.  The shelter has an isolation area for residents who are contagious. It has a kitchen, activity room/commons area, laundry room, treatment room, nurse’s station and a separate area for staff. The shelter has been activated since it’s completion.  It was the first stand-alone medical needs shelter of its kind in the United States. </p> </div>
